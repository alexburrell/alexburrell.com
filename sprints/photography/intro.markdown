## Intro
For this sprint, I've decided (at Boyfriend's urging) to focus on photography. This is something I have wanted to try for a long time, but "never had the time" (yeah, right). But I live in beautiful California, have an adorable kitty, photogenic friends and family, and I've been known to bake some tasty morsels too. My poor iPhone camera skills do none of these justice.

Well not anymore! For the next three weeks, my primary goal, outside of work, is to take pretty pictures. And here I will document every misstep along the way. As an added bonus, I'll hopefully be able to take much better pictures for this site in future sprints.

On February 23rd, I will choose one of my photographs to print and frame.

## Plan
There are two important parts to this sprint: learning technical details about photography, and actually going to take a lot of pictures. For the first part, I'll probably start with Wikipedia, then find blogs and articles to learn more.

As for taking lots of pictures, I want to try as many different types of photography as possible - nature, people, food, movement, light, etc. I'm more than excited to drive around to different cities and natural areas, as well as find some interesting things near home.

I'm also think I know a few photographers and people who are married to photographers, so I'll try to get them into some conversations.

Finally, and this is much less impressive but still a good way to focus on photography, I'm going to post at least a picture a day on Instagram, starting tomorrow. You can find me at [alexfrommichigan](http://instagram.com/alexfrommichigan).

## Materials
For the next three weeks, Boyfriend is lending me his camera, basically enabling this whole sprint. It's a Canon Digital Rebel XSi from 2008, and he has three lenses to go with it:

- 18-55mm kit lense
- 50mm prime (apparently known as the "Nifty Fifty")
- 55-250mm telephoto lense
