## Outcome
I just printed a picture from today to hang on my wall! Here's the one I chose:

> [<img src="photography/feb23-8.jpg" width="750" height="500" alt="Golden Gate Bridge" />](photography/feb23-8.jpg)

To be honest, I didn't have a picture that I absolutely wanted to have hang on my wall, but I do like this one. Boyfriend and I went on a photo-taking adventure today, up the East Bay, to Sausalito, and then down through the city. But the picture I hoped to get - either a panorama of the city, or a good one of Alcatraz - was foiled by San Francisco's infamous fog. I do like the foggy Golden Gate Bridge in the above picture.

The last three weeks have managed to totally dissolve my previous apathy and shyness towards photography. I'm so excited about that, because now everything I do in the future can be much better documented and shared! There's still so much that I can do better, but I now understand the terminology enough to read about it and talk to people about it.

## What's next
A couple weeks ago, I signed up for a photo workshop through [Aperture Academy](http://www.apertureacademy.com). Unfortunately, it had to be postponed due to weather in [Big Sur](http://www.bigsurcalifornia.org). So I'll be going to **Big Sur on March 30th** with a group of photographers and a couple instructors to learn how to take even better photographs.
