My first (bad) photos

Today I picked up a fancy camera for the first time! Let me tell you, that shutter sound is extremely satisfying. It was dark by the time I got home, so I just ran around the apartment snapping pictures. Unfortunately, they all turned out quite bad. I didn't know how to use any of the modes on the camera, but maybe that would help the blurriness. Maybe the lighting too?

I left out all the pictures of my kitty, because they were all dark and blurry.

Anyway, here are some of the pictures I took:

> [<img src="photography/desk.jpg" width="500" height="750" alt="my desk" />](photography/desk.jpg)
> Here's my lovely desk.

> [<img src="photography/wall.jpg" width="750" height="500" alt="my desk" />](photography/wall.jpg)
> The wall by my desk. That beautiful picture of Michigan's campus was painted by my friend's mom.

> Those two cuties are my sisters. These particular pictures have sat on my desk in two states and four countries. Even when I'm packing light, I always bring these pictures.

Learning about my camera

Today I read the following:

- [Basics of Photography](http://lifehacker.com/5815742/basics-of-photography-the-complete-guide) by Lifehacker
- A bunch of tutorials on [geofflawrence.com](http://www.geofflawrence.com)
- [Focal length](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length) on Wikipedia

Basically, I learned what Shutter Speed and Aperture mean, and ISO to a lesser extent. I learned about Manual mode on my camera, and Shutter Speed Priority, and Aperture Priority. Granted, I haven't tried any of this yet, but tomorrow I will!

Crazy cat lady...

At first, Cat was very intrigued by the camera and the loud noise it makes. I think she hates it now. But after Boyfriend went to bed, I was left with one living subject to photograph, and Cat paid the price. I got some cute pictures though! I even gave her a treat for being a good sport and not hiding under the couch. Then she threw up.

Tonight, I discovered the different modes my camera has! I didn't use automatic, but I definitely don't know enough to use fully manual either. Turns out Tv (Shutter Priority) and Av (Aperture Priority) modes are super useful. I still need to learn to adjust things on my own though...

Photo walk around Cupertino

Today, Boyfriend walked with me around Cupertino. We each had cameras and he showed me how to do things like change the aperture and shutter speed, and when I might want to do those things. It was a cloudy day, with a little much-needed rain, but now I know how to account for that!

Here are some of the pictures I took. They have all been touched up a little with iPhoto, but I was really happy even with the originals.

Lazy Sunday

Today was filled with brunch, errands, and baking. That gave me the perfect opportunity to re-attempt some kitchen photos. They actually turned out much better, now that I know about some essential camera adjustments. Turns out my kitchen responds best to the Fluorescent white balance setting...

Anyway, the things I was making didn't photograph well, but that's because they weren't too attractive to begin with. I'll have to make something prettier later this week!

Cookies!

Today I made cookies purely for the purpose of taking pictures. Then I send them away to Boyfriend's work, and it's like it never happened.

The pictures didn't turn out as well as the cookies, but that just means I'll have to make more cookies. Oh well. I think some certain Coworkers won't object either.

Photography technicalities...

- White balancing, while helpful, does not fix my kitchen. I need more help with that. Maybe I'll buy some lamps?
- ISO made no difference at all. From one extreme to the other, I could not distinguish any difference. I'm not sure if I should be able to or not...
- If I try really hard, I can hold the camera steady for shutter speed 1/30. Anything slower than that and I'll need to invest in a tripod.

Buying some equipment

I was lucky enough to start this sprint with a borrowed camera and spare SD card, meaning I had no financial investment while I first tried out photography. Today I took a step and invested in a few nice-to-haves though, so I guess I'm committed!

I bought:

- A [tripod](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZGLM5W/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for long-exposure photos, better outdoor photography, and better photos in general.
- A 32gb SD card, for travel, so I definitely won't run out of space.
- An [SD card reader](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046TJG1U/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for my itty-bitty MacBook Air that doesn't have one built in.

And here are some photos I took tonight, just playing around with the camera:

Going to ski in Telluride

Yesterday, Boyfriend and I got an amazing opportunity to join his family in Telluride for skiing! I've never skied before, and I'm pretty clumsy even on my own feet, so I'm pretty nervous to go tomorrow. But I'll try anything once, so we'll see how this goes!

Of course, this trip also involves some incredible photography opportunities. The mountains and snow are so beautiful here, and I'm hoping to practice landscape, daylight, and lower light photography.

Skiing and scenery

Today I skied! I was with Boyfriend and Family who are all ski experts, so within about an hour, I wore my first pair of ski boots, put on skis, had a quick lesson on stopping, and then all of a sudden I was on a hill! I was *really* nervous, but there was no time to dwell on that. They were all so nice about  the whole thing - especially his dad who very patiently and repeatedly showed me how to maneuver the hill.

After about 4 hours, I had 6 runs under my belt. I'd learned to turn, "pizza", slow down by turning slightly uphill, and just sit my butt down in the snow if I was too out-of-control. I legitimately fell down twice - not bad, given that I also fell down once last week just wearing socks in my living room.

Here are some of the pictures I took from the ski area. I really hope they capture just how gorgeous this place is.

Downtown Telluride

This afternoon I joined Boyfriend's mom and sister shopping in downtown Telluride. My main motivation was to take pictures of this nice little street. To be honest, most of the pictures I took today weren't very good. My biggest issue was framing - I either couldn't get far enough away to fit everything in, or couldn't figure out how to get a pretty picture with all the cars and people and buildings.

Unfortunately there wasn't a lot of time in this quick weekend to try a bunch of different things, but I think in San Francisco I'll be able to find a similar setting and practice more.

Here are some of the better ones from the day:

Tripod and long exposure

Today my tripod finally arrived, so I played a little with long exposure. And until tonight, I thought "long exposure" meant maybe 1/10 of a second, or even 1 second. Turns out it can mean multiple seconds or even more than a minute! (Although nothing about the inside of my apartment is interesting enough to leave the shutter open for more than a minute. I'll try that this weekend in SF.)

Here are some of the lame long exposure experiments I tried with a laser pointer:

Lenses and the ocean

Today, Boyfriend and I drove out to Half Moon Bay with our cameras to take some ocean pictures. He showed me how to change lenses on the camera, so I took the kit lense (18-55mm), which means I was able to zoom for the first time!
