## Intro
*Note: This sprint is somewhat unusual, as I didn't have a place to put content, and I didn't know what content I actually wanted to display. Empty days above don't mean I didn't make progress, it just means I was iterating a lot.*

For years, I had a personal site that I used as both a resume and a playground for trying things out. However, when I got a full-time job in web development, I stopped maintaining that. Now, a year and a half later, it's time to get back to it.

This time, my personal site will be a place to track these little [sprints](../sprint-rules.html).

I want it to be pretty, simple, and representative of me. I don't have much experience with design, so I'm trying to focus on that (and it will be a work in progress). It should also be easy to maintain and create new content.

On or before February 2nd, I will publish my new site.

## Plan
I already worked on this a little late last year, so I'm not starting from scratch. I'll be putting together some content, and working on the markup and CSS. But the biggest part of this project, I think, will be the build tool.

I want to create content in a combination of JSON data and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown). I know there are lots of site-generation tools, and I'm not usually for reinventing the wheel, but I like this experiment. I want to make something simple and specialized.

## Materials
One of the best things about web development - all I need is a computer (I have an 11" Macbook Air), a text editor (Sublime Text), and the internet.

I plan to use Python for the build tool, [Mustache templates](http://mustache.github.io) and Markdown for page generation, and jQuery and [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) on the front end.

I'll also be searching around for design inspiration. Here are some of the sites I frequent for inspiration:

- [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com)
- [Awwwards](http://www.awwwards.com)
- [Design Instruct](http://designinstruct.com)
