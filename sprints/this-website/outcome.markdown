## Outcome
My first sprint was in China - I really had no excuse to not succeed there. But this time, it was all up to me keeping my deadline and finishing my website in 3 weeks. And it worked! It's not perfect, and I already have a list of things that I want to change or do, but it's live!

I wouldn't say I learned a bunch of new things doing this - I did put things together in a way I never have before though. And for the build script in particular, it was fun making that with myself as the only "client". Every feature I added was purely to make my life easier, and progress came quickly and easily. I really appreciate all the tools that make up my content creation environment, in particular Markdown, Mustache, Sublime, and Byword.

## What's next
Well, this site is really a platform for all future sprints, so I'll keep building on it that way. But I here are some of the things I want to do on the site itself:

- Make a 404 page
- Add a few "Easter Egg" type things
- Get my build script to under 200 lines (just for fun)
- Make a few design alterations
- Put the whole mess on Github

Little things, that in no way lessen my satisfaction in the last three weeks.
