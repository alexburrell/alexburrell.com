## Intro
*Note: This sprint is a little weird, because I'm writing all of this after the fact. I didn't come up with this idea, formally, until it was a little too late. But it fits so perfectly as my first sprint, so I'm still including it.*

*As a result, though, the content isn't completely filled out. I'm trying to fill out the days before this [site launches](this-website.html), but this will be much easier when the site already exists and I can write in real time.*

In high school, I studied abroad in China for a year through [AFS](http://www.afsusa.org). I knew no Chinese before going, but it turns out that you progress very quickly when your options are either learn the language or don't talk to people.

Anyway, seven years later, I'd lost a lot of my hard-earned Chinese. Knowing it would return quickly if I were immersed again, I found a Mandarin school in Beijing and decided to go for three weeks.

My goal was to not only regain my previous comfort with the language, but to actually improve beyond that. I'm now older with more confidence, more experience, and less fear of making mistakes, so with immersion I improved very quickly.

Unfortunately, I didn't have a good concrete way to measure this goal, so I had to base success on my ability to communicate with people while there.

## Plan
I attended [Live the Language](http://www.livethelanguage.cn) school in Beijing for three full weeks. I chose them for a few reasons:
- They have a strong web presence, allowing me to learn a lot about them before committing.
- Besides a variety of classes, they offer housing, local connections, and other services to help people actually move to China, both short-term and long-term.
- They were always quick to get back to me, and very helpful with planning and any questions.

Although shared apartments were available, I chose to live with a host family in order to get a full 24/7 immersion. After a Skype interview to assess my Chinese level, they suggested 4 hours a day of group classes, and 2 hours a day of one-on-one.

Beyond this, I planned to try and avoid English as much as possible, including music, movies, and 外国人 (non-Chinese people).

## Materials
There were only a few things I brought with me to China (all packed in one backpack!) but most importantly was my **iPhone**. It was the only computing device that I brought, so I used it for communication, booking my [trip to Harbin](#january-04 "calendar"), finding my way around, and looking things up. It was also my only camera.

The most valuable app I had there (besides an internet browser) was [Pleco](http://www.pleco.com), the best Chinese dictionary I've ever used. Most appreciated was its offline functionality.

I also brought **gifts** with me - a must when visiting locals in China. The gift itself usually isn't as important as the thought and the meaning. It should definitely be something from your home town or state. I brought chocolates, dried fruits, and some Apple t-shirts. Through my trip, I doled these out to my host family, teachers, and some other random people I met.

Finally, in Chinese class, we used the following books:
