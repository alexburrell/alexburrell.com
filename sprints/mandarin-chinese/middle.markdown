Arriving in Beijing

Arrived in Beijing after more than 20 hours of travel from San Francisco through Vancouver. I flew Air Canada for the first time - they're awesome! USB outlets at every seat, and the friendliest flight crew.

I opted to not be picked up at the airport (a convenience offered by [Live the Language school](http://www.livethelanguage.cn)), and instead took the cheap and easy Airport Express to downtown Beijing.

After all that traveling, I was exhausted and unable to process any of the Chinese I encountered on my way to the hotel. A little ashamed, I spoke only English to the receptionist.

If I'd been less tired, I might have worried more, wondering if I'd lost too much to recover in such a short time. Instead, I took a shower and fell asleep.

Finding my host family

After speaking English yesterday to the hotel receptionist, I had to redeem myself. I could have looked up directions to my host family on my phone, but instead I went downstairs to the conceirge and asked directions. It was a little rough, but I was communicating in Chinese, and as such, he was very enthusiastic about helping me.

Against his suggestion that I take a taxi, I insisted on taking the subway. He wrote down some subway instructions for the crazy 老外 and I was on my way. Turns out he might have had a point. It took a good hour of wandering, but after showing the address to a couple people on the street, I did find my way.

Ignoring that nervous discomfort in my gut, I knocked on the door of complete strangers, only a little certain that I was at the right apartment at all.

A Chinese woman, about my mother's age, opened the door with a big smile and welcomed me in. She spoke no English (exactly what I was hoping for!) but that didn't stop her from pretty much nonstop chatting and questioning. Her husband also spoke no English, but was more reserved around me.

They have a 22-year old son who did speak a little English, but realized we were more effective conversing in Chinese than English.

This was clearly going to be an excellent environment for improving Chinese - this family was funny, outgoing, and relaxed.

The mental strain of trying to communicate in Chinese, combined with jet lag, had me totally exhausted by 7pm. I'd overcome a few big hurdles (finding the family, conversing fully in Chinese for the first time in years), but I was still nervous about my first day of classes!

## December 23
First day of classes

I left really early for class, partly because I was ready to go at 5am (jet lag), and partly because I was nervous and excited. This was a good choice, as the school building was quite difficult to find. My host mom offered to drive me, even though it was out of her way, but I told her I could take the bus.

An hour later, and an hour early for class, I arrived at Live the Language. Yes, they laughed at me for being so early, but then they offered me a cup of hot water and showed me around the school.

> <img src="mandarin-chinese/classroom.png" width="345" height="345" alt="classroom at chinese school" />

It's a small unit in a large high-rise, split between the 16th and 19th floors. In total there are maybe ten classrooms, and students range from total beginner to intermediate. Some stay for months or a year, some for only a few weeks. They're from all over the world, although while I was there, it was mostly Europeans and Australians. I hear it becomes much busier in the summer, but there were at least 20 students there in December and January still.

In my group class, there were only two other students, both of whom had been there for months. It was the most advanced class there, and although I could have handled a more difficult class, I definitely didn't feel like I was wasting my time.

The one-on-one class was my favorite though, although I felt like I needed a cup of tea and a nap afterwards. In a one-on-one language class, there is absolutely no hiding when you aren't sure of something. The most valuable skill is being able to just try things, say things, even though it might be very wrong. And I was often very wrong, and sometimes she laughed, but it was ok. The only thing that mattered was getting better at Chinese.

After class, I headed home to a homecooked meal and a couple hours of conversation with my host mom at the kitchen table. Then I passed out, because that's completely exhausting.

Christmas in China

Nothing exciting happened today. But really, that's kind of the point. I gave up celebrating Christmas, my most favorite holiday, to return to China and Chinese. And you know what? Totally worth it.

I went to class all day, and then returned home instead of going out to Sanlitun 三里屯, a popular foreigner district, with the other foreign students. Actually, my host family did make dinner a little more special that night. They bought some fruits and sweets for the occasion, and played some Christmas music that I've never heard of before. It was very sweet of them.

Make up New Years classes

Because school has New Year's Day off, we made up 4 hours of class today. I really appreciated that extra effort on the part of the teachers there, especially because I only had 15 days of class to begin with.

## December 29
Olympic park and Hutong

Today my host brother took me around Beijing. I've already been to the normal Beijing spots - the Great Wall, Forbidden City, Summery Palace, etc. So he took me to the Olympic Park from the 2008 Beijing Olympics and to a traditional Hutong area.

Hutongs are old-style narrow streets and homes, now rare in Beijing as they've been destroyed to make way for high-rises. Many are preserved now though, and are a popular tourist destination. They are full of street food, gift shops, and people.

We wandered around the main area, then went off the beaten path, so to speak, and saw areas where people are actually living. I had a fantastic day getting to know my host brother, and exchanging lots of colloquial Chinese and English phrases.

New Years at Sanlitun

Tonight was an exception to my general rule of choosing host family and Chinese friends over going out with the other foreign students. For Chinese people, December 31st pales in comparison to Chinese New Year a month later.

I ended up going out to dinner and then to Sanlitun 三里屯 with the other students. Once you're there, you can barely tell you're in China anymore. The bars are filled with foreigners. The Chinese people that are there are mostly offering the types of things that I guess certain foreigners go to China to find. I was offered a few different things that I wasn't interested in, just in my half an hour of walking around.

Overall, not my favorite place, but I'm glad I joined them to celebrate the New Year.

Going to "grandma's" house

On my day off from school, we headed to my host mom's mother's house. We had a nice Peking duck 北京烤鸭 lunch, and I got to see one of the "suburbs" of Beijing.

The only person who knew a little English was my host mom's niece, a high school student. She asked me for help on homework, and I started walking her through the directions. But she wanted me to do it for her, and when I didn't, she looked it up online and copied that word-for-word. A glimpse into what Chinese high school students resort to when they are completely overwhelmed with homework and preparing for their [university exam 高考](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Higher_Education_Entrance_Examination).

It was a great day though - I always appreciate when people invite me to see how they really live, not worrying about doing anything too special.

Central Perk coffee shop

In Beijing, they have recreated [Central Perk](http://friends.wikia.com/wiki/Central_Perk) from Friends! It's on the 6th floor of a high-rise, surrounded by offices and salons. I was sure I was in the wrong place, until I turned a corner and saw this...

It was *awesome*.

Arriving in Harbin

For years and years, I've wanted to go to Harbin in northern China and see the [Snow and Ice Festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbin_International_Ice_and_Snow_Sculpture_Festival). Well, here I found myself in China in the wintertime. I had to go!

I had to fly to Harbin, because all the train tickets were sold out. It was more expensive to fly, but not *too* much more. I booked tickets and a hotel room, talked to a few Harbin natives for advice, and gathered the warmest clothes I had. Good thing too, because it's well below zero in Harbin!

> <img src="mandarin-chinese/harbin-plane.png" width="400" height="300" alt="plane to harbin" />

After landing around 10am, I took a coach bus from the airport to the city (less than half what a taxi would cost) and found my hotel. The hotel couldn't possibly have been in a better location, and it was only $30-40 for a room. I highly recommend the [Harbin Gfour Holiday Hotel](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g297433-d1527174-Reviews-Gfour_Holiday_Hotel-Harbin_Heilongjiang.html).

> <img src="mandarin-chinese/harbin.png" width="375" height="400" alt="popsicle in harbin" />
> Despite the temperature, everyone eats these popsicles outside. Crazy!

I wandered around in the afternoon, seeing the [pedestrian street](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297433-d543118-Reviews-Zhongyang_Pedestrian_Street-Harbin_Heilongjiang.html) and the frozen river. At night, the hotel arranged a driver to take me and a few other guests to the Ice Festival. It has to be seen at night because everything is elaborately lit from within the ice.

> <img src="mandarin-chinese/ice-festival.png" width="400" height="375" alt="ice festival in harbin" />

After returning to my room from the Ice Festival, it took about an hour to warm up. Worth it, but definitely will be more careful about bringing warm clothes if I go again!

Exploring Harbin

On my second day in Harbin, I headed straight for the Snow Festival.

> There's a snow slide off to the left on this all-snow structure.

> <img src="mandarin-chinese/snow-festival-2.png" width="350" height="375" alt="snow sculpture in harbin" />

I spent a few hours wandering around these incredible snow structures and sculptures, stopping every half hour or so to get a cup of tea or water and sit inside for a bit. It was truly painfully cold.

When I was done there, I headed to find lunch at a Russian restaurant, and then it was nearly time to fly back to Beijing! Such a fantastic weekend, and something I have waited years to see.

And since I traveled totally by myself, it was an excellent test of my Chinese skills.

The Silk Market

Tonight I decided to brave the Silk Market 秀水街, a place I was pretty sure I'd never go to (too touristy). But I wanted to get a gift for my sisters with their Chinese names (they're adopted from China), like calligraphy, and I heard this was a reliable place to find that.

It wasn't too busy when I went, and I never felt like my belongings were at risk. I'd been warned to watch for pickpockets, and this was enforced by many signs at the market itself, but it never seemed like an issue.

The first few floors are clothing and other average goods, not really souvenir material. However, up on the 4th or 5th floor, every shop was selling the souvenirs Westerners love to bring back from China. Chopsticks, those hand-exercise balls, Buddha statues, signs of all sorts, etc.

I decided on one selling [stamps](http://www.chinaonlinemuseum.com/carving-seals.php) like the kind emperors would use, with my sisters' names carved into them. Then came the bargaining! I think this part is really fun, especially in Chinese. We talked for about 20 minutes before deciding on a price (about 40% of the original - not bad but not my best).

Overall, I was never planning to go to the Silk Market, but for this specific purpose it was perfect, and I had a lot of fun talking to the shopkeepers there.

Local marketplace

Tonight after class, I headed to a local market with my host mom.

> <img src="mandarin-chinese/market.png" width="300" height="300" alt="local market" />
> The food portion of the market

The market had a food area and a "goods" area. First we went looking for a souvenir for my sisters. My host mom fell in love with them after finding out they're adopted from China (and seeing the many videos and pictures I showed her), and wanted to get them a gift.

> <img src="mandarin-chinese/sisters.png" width="300" height="300" alt="my sisters" />
> My favorite girls

Then she needed some food for dinner. She wanted to make me fish - a self-proclaimed specialty. Unfortunately, buying fish in China tends to be a pretty disturbing process for anyone who doesn't like seeing animals suffer. The fish are kept barely alive in shallow bowls. Shoppers choose their fish, and it is killed, gutted, and scaled right there. I looked away, but it still bothered me a bit.

## January 10
Jewelry shopping

Tonight my host brother was supposed to come home, but something came up. My host mom was clearly bummed about that, and wanted to go out and do something. So we went jewelry shopping!

Now, this is something I have never done. I don't have my ears pierced, and I haven't worn so much as a necklace in years. But I think she's more the "average woman" than I am, and it cheered her up.

> <img src="mandarin-chinese/jewelry-store.png" width="275" height="212" alt="department store jewelry store" />

The jewelry floor in the department store was painfully bright and shiny, and, at least to my untrained eye, looked exactly the same in every direction. But as we wandered, some stuck out to her and we'd go carefully examine every piece at that counter. She asked my opinion on every piece, and sometimes try a pair of earrings on (actually try them on, without them being wiped down!) or a bracelet.

We didn't buy anything - it's all *really* expensive, even by Western standards. She did come up with a little game where we'd look at a display, and at the count of three (or 三 rather), point to the one we liked best. We actually pointed to the same one more often than not, so that was fun!

The shop clerks never did talk to me, but were fascinated watching me talk to my host mom.

My last day in China

I had my last day of class today - just two hours leftover from New Years. The chapter lesson gave way to conversation, which I had no problem with. The conversation was entirely in Chinese, and therefore was as good as (or better than) the formal lesson.

The rest of the day was spent packing and hanging out at home with my host family. Nothing too exciting, but by this time, I was completely comfortable functioning, chatting, and joking around in Chinese. Feeling accomplished, and after three weeks away from work and life in California, I was ready to go home.
