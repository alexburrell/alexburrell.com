## Outcome
My Chinese level improved *dramatically* in the three weeks I was in China. Especially in the first few days, I could feel my comfort level improve between morning and night. It was one of the most fun things I've experienced.

The school I chose ([Live the Language](http://www.livethelanguage.cn)) was great, the teachers in particular. My only regret might be that I didn't take advantage of their program in Chengdu 成都, and stayed in Beijing the whole time. This is a minor regret, as I really couldn't know in advance that I wouldn't like Beijing, and the host family was especially redeeming.

Beijing wasn't terrible, but it does join a short list of places that I have little need to return to. It's a large busy city with quite a bit of Western influence, and they aren't exaggerating when they talk about the pollution there.

That said, the only goal I had was to immerse myself in Chinese, and I did achieve that. I'm now back at work, and able to converse with Chinese colleagues, which is a lot of fun.

## What's next
I'm really busy here, which is why I required this total break from normal life to regain my Chinese. But I will try to find opportunities to keep it up. Besides a few Chinese coworkers and friends, I'm keeping my eye out for language meetups in the Bay Area, and other opportunities to spend time with Chinese people. I'm also listening to more Chinese music, and I'm looking for a Chinese show that I enjoy.

And it might end up that I just go back to China every few years and do a short language refresher.
