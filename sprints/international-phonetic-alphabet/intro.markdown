## Intro
The [International Phonetic Alphabet](http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/) is a standard notation for the world's languages. Basically, there is a symbol for a sound, and something written in the IPA is unambiguous - you can know exactly how it's pronounced. Over the years since its inception in the late 1800s, new letters have been added to account for unique sounds in different languages.

In theory, if I can read the IPA, I'll know how words are pronounced even in languages that I don't know. That seems cool, so these next three weeks I'm going to learn the IPA. (Granted, the IPA is not used everywhere and phonetic transcriptions might not be available in some languages, but if it is, I'll be able to read it!)

I thought this would be a cool idea a long time ago when I read [this article](http://lifehacker.com/5903288/i-learned-to-speak-four-languages-in-a-few-years-heres-how), which talks about learning how a language is pronounced as the first step to learning that language. And over the last year or so, I've looked at various websites and resources about the IPA. There's quite a bit out there, but nothing struck me as really what I was hoping to find, so I'm going to make the tool that I was looking for.

At the end of this sprint, I will put a link to the finished ("finished") product out there on some different linguistics sites and see what people think.

## Plan
There are some things I know I have to do, and others that I only have a vague sense of, or that will come up over the course of the sprint.

Here's what I know:

- I have to get an font on my computer that can display everything, and figure out how to best show IPA text on my site.
- [The official IPA chart](http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/IPA_chart_(C)2005.pdf) is very important, but kind of confusing. I'd like to re-visualize it and add some additional information and functionality.
- I want to end up with a central resource with thorough information, tools for learning, and links to different resources.

I suspect that I'll want some sort of flashcard or other practice tool, but I'm not sure what yet. And I'll want to find as many IPA resources for different languages as possible, but I'm not sure what I'll do with that yet.

## Materials
Here are some of the resources I know of so far that I'll be obsessively reading over the next couple weeks:

- [The International Phonetic Association](http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/)
- [The Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), of course
- [Omniglot](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/ipa.htm)
- [Many](http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~kjohnson/English_Phonetics/) [various](https://teaching.ncl.ac.uk/ipa/practical-exercises.html) [practice](http://cla.calpoly.edu/~jrubba/phon/weeklypractice.html) [sites](http://www.ipatrainer.com/user/site/?language=)

I also have the [Handbook of the IPA](http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa/handbook.html) on my Kindle, so I'll be looking through that.
