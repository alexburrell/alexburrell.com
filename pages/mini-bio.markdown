Hi there! I'm Alex.

I grew up in Michigan, where I started making websites as a kid. My first pages were creaded in Notepad on Windows ME, and looked something like this:

	<body bgcolor="black">
		<frameset>
			<frame src="header.html">
				<center>
					<font size="2" color="white">All the songs on my cassette tapes</font>
				</center>
			</frame>

	</body>

I remember working on a project for a local political candidate while in high school, and my dad told me about CSS for the first time. I spent the rest of that day and through the night rewriting everything I was working on. It was exciting!

Javascript and PHP were added to my repertoire in a similar fashion, and I went through high school making sites for myself and a few for other people too.

Somewhere along the way, though, I changed course. My first two years of college passed in a frenzy of psychology, philosophy, political science, and languages courses and a [stint in Thailand](http://journey2thailand.blogspot.com). I loved it, but I didn't know what I wanted to focus on.

Until my junior year, when I rediscovered web development, and started taking Computer Science classes. So much fun! Over the next two years, I learned C++, fell in love with Python, and got a little tired of Java. I finished my new degree, and somehow landed myself an internship at Apple!

I've now joined Apple full-time, doing front end development on the [Online Store](http://store.apple.com). A year and a half in, and still every single day I'm excited to go to work.

Anyway, thanks so much for visiting, and please get in touch if you want. Have a wonderful <span class="day-of-week">day</span>!
