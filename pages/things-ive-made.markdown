	> These were incredibly simple to put together. My boyfriend took the picture - it took all of 2 minutes - then I printed them at Walgreens. I bought the snowflake brads from Michaels and used those to attach the photo to blank cards. The whole thing cost about $15 and about a couple hours (mostly spent writing messages).
