What's a "sprint"?
---

This is just my attempt to avoid being paralyzed by too many options. Instead of getting overwhelmed by this endless stream of things I want to do or try or learn - a situation I've found myself in often - I will **focus on one thing** for a predefined period of time.

*Note: I do realize this is the same terminology used in the [agile method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), but I didn't know about agile at the time. It just happens to be the perfect term for their intent and mine.*

Here are the rules:

1. The predefined period of time will almost always be three weeks.
2. Make at least a little progress every day.
3. Have a measurable goal for the end of the sprint.
4. Really focus, for those three weeks, on this one thing. Avoid getting distracted by things that can be given a dedicated sprint later.
